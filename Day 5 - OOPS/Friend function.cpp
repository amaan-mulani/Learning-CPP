friend function:
Friend function is not a member function.
Still has all the rights of a member function.
A friend function is an outsider which can still access private data. 
friend function either uses reference or direct object for access. 
One must pass an object to a friend using the '.' operator to access private data. 
User's friend keyword during declaration.
It is a prototype within a class, but declared and defined outside.
Will be called directly without any object.
